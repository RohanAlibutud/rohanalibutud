# Rohan Alibutud

![PageBanner](/PageBanner.png)

My name is Rohan Ferriols-Alibutud, although most places I just go by Rohan Alibutud, since even that name is enough of a linguistic flashbang for people not familiar with Filipino nomenclature.

I graduated Rutgers University with a Bachelor of Science in both Evolutionary Anthropology and Genetics, two fields with very different methods that are nonetheless interested in very similar questions. 

I am currently a first-year Bioinformatics PhD student at the [Institute for Genomic Evolutionary Medicine at Temple University, in the lab of Dr. Sudhir Kumar](https://kumarlab.net/home). 

## About Me

Bones-wise, I am a graduate of the [Turkana Basin Institute Origins Field School](https://www.turkanabasin.org/fieldschool/) affiliated with Stony Brook University and the National Museums of Kenya. I spent a semester at active fields sites at both the Mpala Research Center and the Turkana Basin Institute, studying ecology, geology, fossil anthropology, and archaeology.

Genes-wise, I completed an honors thesis on copy number variation in autism-associated genes under the advisory of [Dr. Jinchuan Xing](https://xinglab.genetics.rutgers.edu/) of the Genetics Department and [Dr. Erin Vogel](https://evolution.rutgers.edu/people/ches-faculty/ches-faculty-member/74-ches-faculty/118-erin-r-vogel) of the Anthropology Department. Material from this thesis would later be published as part of a [paper in *eLife*](https://elifesciences.org/articles/82809), as well as a paper for which I was a co-first author that was [published in *IJMS.*](https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/24/17/13248)
